# ICR-Identifying-Age-Related-Conditions
This project, part of an InVitro Cell Research competition, aims to predict if a person has three medical conditions (Class 1) or none (Class 0) using health measurements, streamlining a lengthy data collection process to protect patient privacy and aid researchers in understanding the condition-characteristics relationship.

Welcome to our ICR-Identifying-Age-Related-Conditions project, where we dive into the realm of healthcare and machine learning! In this project, we tackled the ICR - Identifying Age-Related Conditions Dataset using cutting-edge technology, TensorFlow Decision Forests, to address the critical task of predicting if an individual has one or more of three age-related medical conditions or none at all.

Project Overview:
In the quest to make healthcare more efficient and accessible, we leveraged the power of machine learning to streamline the identification of age-related conditions. Our notebook provides a step-by-step guide on training a baseline Random Forest model using TensorFlow Decision Forests, making it accessible for both beginners and seasoned data scientists.Throughout our journey, we explored various models, including: Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Dataset:
We utilized the ICR - Identifying Age-Related Conditions dataset, generously provided for this competition. This dataset is a treasure trove of health measurements, allowing us to decipher the complex relationship between these measurements and age-related medical conditions.
